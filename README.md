# Hello, I'm Nawras 👋

👨‍💻 Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I'm a backend-focused software engineer, passionate about building scalable systems and crafting clean, efficient code — with a cup of coffee in one hand and a debugger in the other ☕🔧

Here, you’ll find a mix of projects, experiments, and maybe a few late-night ideas turned into code.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💼 Currently a full-time Software Engineer in the government sector, leading backend development and API integrations.
- 🌐 I work on designing and maintaining secure, scalable web systems, with a strong focus on RESTful APIs and performance optimization.
- 🧩 I enjoy bridging systems together — whether through custom APIs, third-party integrations, or reworking backend flows for better efficiency.
- 🌍 Previously interned in the Netherlands and UAE, gaining hands-on experience in frontend and full-stack environments.
- 🧠 I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and building solutions that *actually* make life easier.
